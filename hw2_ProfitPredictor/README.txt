\
Profit Predictor is a single runnable Python script that predicts the profit of a coffee shop based on the population of its city.\
\
After running the program you have the option to enter the name of your CSV file or if you want to use the default training sample \'93hwk2data.txt\'94 just press return. \
\
Next, you can choose whether you want to use gradient descent algorithm or normal equation. If gradient descent is chosen, at the end you will get the predicted profit and a scatter plot with the training data and its linear regression.\
\
If you would like to see the live J( ) vs. number of iterations plot, please uncomment the plotting lines in gradientDescent function.\
